            <p>Happy Mother's Day, ma! You don't know how much you mean to me. I love you more than you think. Thank you for fighting for us even in times you feel like you wish you could just give up. All your efforts are seen, ma. I hope one day you/we'd be able to buy you things we couldn't afford before. I know that life is hard but we just have to keep living it because wla tay choice. Sorry ma sa akong mga sala, unta ilove gihapon ko nimo maski ug maunsa ko. Our life is just simple but I'm thankful nga ikaw akong mama, ma. I love you. I hope this simple act of love will make you feel special today. Happy Mother's Day, ma!</p>
